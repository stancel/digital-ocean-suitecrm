install-bareos-client
=========

A role to install the bareos client onto an Ubuntu machine and open up the required firewall ports (9102) so that it can communicate with the bareos-director server component.

Requirements
------------

None. Well, you'll want to already be using Bareos or Bacula if you are using this role.

Role Variables
--------------

The bareos client's password 
```
	client_password: "Some very long string password here (47 characters)"
```
Which (numerical) version of Ubuntu you are installing this onto (default = 16.04)
```
	bareos_ubuntu_install_version: "16.04"
```
Dependencies
------------

None

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

	- hosts: your_server
	  vars_files:
	    - vars/main.yml
	  roles:
	    - { role: stancel.install-bareos-client }


or 

	- hosts: your_server 
	  vars:
		client_password: "Some very long string password here"
		bareos_ubuntu_install_version: "16.04"
	  roles:
	    - { role: stancel.install-bareos-client }
